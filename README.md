I have been working with software since 2011, and I am always improving by studying new languages, what problems they solve, and how much they can improve my productivity.
I am a Full Stack Engineer (front-end heavier) focused on React and Node.

The tools I use to continuously evaluate my performance are Wakatime and Toggl. In this way, I am moved to deliver high-quality apps on the results' pursuit.

I’m a very calm, reliable, and easygoing person. I make careful decisions and have a flawless execution covered by a lot of testing. Always willing to help my teammates.
My most important values are God, Family, and Health.

In addition, I like reading books, music, traveling, video games, movies, and I play the piano as a hobby.
